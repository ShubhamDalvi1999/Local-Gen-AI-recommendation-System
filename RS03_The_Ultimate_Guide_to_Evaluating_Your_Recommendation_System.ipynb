        "\n",
        "2. Focus on the top-ranked item: MRR emphasizes the importance of the first relevant item in the list, making it a useful metric for scenarios where users are likely to focus on the top recommendations and ignore the rest.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Average performance: MRR calculates the mean reciprocal rank across all users, providing an overall measure of the recommendation system's performance. This allows for a fair comparison of different algorithms or models, as it considers the average performance rather than specific user cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Intuitive interpretation: MRR scores range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance. This makes it easy to interpret and compare the performance of different recommendation algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "The cons of Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Limited scope: MRR focuses exclusively on the first relevant item in the list and does not take into account other relevant items or their positions. This can be a limitation in scenarios where multiple relevant items or the overall ranking quality are important.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Binary relevance assumption: MRR assumes a binary relevance scale (either relevant or not relevant) and does not account for varying degrees of relevance on a continuous scale. This can be a limitation in situations where the relevance of items is not binary and needs to be quantified more granularly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Lack of personalization: While MRR provides an average performance measure across all users, it may not fully capture the personalized aspect of recommendation systems. A high MRR score does not necessarily guarantee that the recommendation system is providing good recommendations for each individual user.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Sensitivity to outliers: MRR can be sensitive to outliers, as it calculates the reciprocal rank of the first relevant item for each user. A few users with very low reciprocal ranks can significantly impact the overall MRR score, potentially making it less reliable for evaluating the general performance of a recommendation system.\n",

        "1. Position-aware: MAP takes into account the position of relevant items in the recommendation list, rewarding systems that rank relevant items higher. This makes it suitable for evaluating ranking-based recommendation systems where the order of items matters.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Relevance-aware: MAP considers the relevance of items by calculating the average precision for each user, which is the average of the precision scores at each relevant item's position. This means that it can distinguish between different levels of relevance when evaluating recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Average performance: MAP calculates the mean average precision across all users, providing an overall measure of the recommendation system's performance. This allows for a fair comparison of different algorithms or models, as it considers the average performance rather than specific user cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Robustness: MAP is less sensitive to outliers compared to some other metrics, as it calculates the average precision across multiple positions in the recommendation list for each user. This robustness makes it more reliable for evaluating the general performance of a recommendation system.\n",
        "\n",
        "The cons of Mean Average Precision (MAP) include:\n",
        "1. Binary relevance assumption: MAP assumes a binary relevance scale (either relevant or not relevant) and does not account for varying degrees of relevance on a continuous scale. This can be a limitation in situations where the relevance of items is not binary and needs to be quantified more granularly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Lack of personalization: While MAP provides an average performance measure across all users, it may not fully capture the personalized aspect of recommendation systems. A high MAP score does not necessarily guarantee that the recommendation system is providing good recommendations for each individual user.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Not suitable for all scenarios: MAP is more appropriate for recommendation scenarios where a ranked list of items is provided to users. It may not be suitable for other types of recommendation scenarios, such as collaborative filtering or content-based recommendations that do not involve explicit ranking.\n",

        "1. Position-aware: Unlike some other metrics, nDCG takes into account the position of the relevant items in the recommendation list.
